# Sales Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to derive actionable insights. It involves the use of Python (Jupyter Notebooks) for data analysis and MySQL for querying the dataset. The project is divided into four major portions:

1. **Sales and Profit Analysis**
2. **Trend Analysis**
3. **Shipping and Delivery Patterns**
4. **Year-over-Year Growth**

The dataset includes information about orders, such as order dates, product categories, regions, shipping modes, sales, and profits.
